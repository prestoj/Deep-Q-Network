# Deep-Q Network

This is an implementation of a Deep-Q Network as eloquently outlined by Tambet Matiisen [here](https://www.intelnervana.com/demystifying-deep-reinforcement-learning/). It is made to solve gym's CartPole, but with some minor tweaks, it can solve other problems as well.

The purpose of this was really to get to understand how to use both Keras, and the new TensorFlow Eager for reinforcement learning.
